QPL parsing tree is a formalism to describe data retrieval operations over an SQL schema in a modular manner.
A QPL plan is a sequence of instructions for querying tabular data to answer a natural language question.
Forget everything you know about SQL, only use the following explanations.

A schema is specified as a list of <table> specification in the format:
<table>: <comma separated list of columns>

A plan contains a sequence of operations.
All operations return a stream of tuples.
All operations take as input either a physical table from the schema (for the Scan operation) or the output of other operations.

This is the formal specification for each operation:

<step> ::= 1...n

Scan ::= #<step> = Scan Table [ <tableName> ] <Predicate>? Output [ <fieldName>+ ]

// Binary operations
Join ::= Join ( #<InputStep1>, #<InputStep2> ) <Predicate> Output [ <qualifiedFieldName>+ ]
Intersect ::= Intersect  ( #<InputStep1>, #<InputStep2> ) <Predicate>? Output [ <qualifiedFieldName>+ ]
Except ::= Except ( #<InputStep1>, #<InputStep2> ) Output [ <qualifiedFieldName>+ ]
Union ::= Union ( #<InputStep1>, #<InputStep2> ) Output [ <qualifiedFieldName>+ ]

// Unary operations
Aggregate ::= Aggregate ( #<InputStep> ) <GroupBy>? Output [ <fieldName>+ | (<Agg> as <aliasName>)]
Filter ::= Filter ( #<InputStep> ) <Predicate> Output [ <fieldName>+ ]
TopSort ::= TopSort  ( #<InputStep> ) Rows [ <numRows> ] OrderBy [ <fieldName> ASC | DESC ] Output [ <fieldName>+ ]
Top ::= Top ( #<InputStep> ) Rows [ <numRows> ] Output [ <fieldName>+ ]
Sort ::= Sort  ( #<InputStep> ) OrderBy [ <fieldName> ASC | DESC ] (Distinct [ true ])? Output [ <fieldName>+ ]

// Predicate, Aggregate, Sort
Predicate ::= Predicate [ (Comparison AND | OR)+ ]
Comparison ::= ( countstar | <Agg> ) <ComparisonOp> ( countstar | <Agg> | Number | NULL )
Agg ::= ( AVG | COUNT | SUM | MIN | MAX ) ( <fieldName> )
ComparisonOp ::= <> | <= | >= | IS NOT | IS | LIKE | < | > | =
GroupBy ::= GroupBy [ <fieldName>+ ]


Let's think step by step to convert QPL plan to natural language plan given scheme, question, and QPL that describe the question.

In the natural language plan:
1. You must have exactly the same number of questions as there are steps in the QPL.
2. The questions you generate must follow exactly the same order as the steps in the QPL.


Example 1:

Schema:
